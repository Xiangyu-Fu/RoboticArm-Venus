# RoboticArm-Venus
the second formal projects which I am doing. But it suspend for a long time, because I find I need to design the moter driver board to build a better connection among all the links. Besides, FOC-control maybe a better solution of the motor control. 

## progress
I plan to design the core control board using the FOC control. But I need some hardware design experience, So that is why I begin the Drone-Mercury Project. 

## Images
Actually, I have already finish the mechanical part. Here are some images about the latest version of the robot arm.
